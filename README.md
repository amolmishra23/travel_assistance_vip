## Travel Assistance System for a Virtually Impaired Person

Of all the 37 million blind people across the world, 15 million are from India. Talking signs, guide cane, echolocations are all useful in navigating the visually challenged people to reach their destination, but the main objective is not attained as it fails to join them with the traffic. In India, the common way of public transport is bus. Therefore, for a visually impaired person, buses are vital in enabling him to participate fully in the society to access facilities and services. 

In most of the cases after reaching a bus stop, the blind person is well aware of his destination and the bus number that would lead him to his destination. But that he can’t see for the bus coming and most of the bus stops don’t have proper announcement system to convey the arrival of bus. So, there should be some mechanism using which he should be hinted as soon as a bus arrives to the stop he is standing at. 

In order to solve the above mentioned problems we are proposing a bus system using wireless networks. The blind person, bus and bus stop will have their networking devices respectively. When the blind person enters the bus number he intends to board on in his device, he would be informed as soon as the bus arrives at the bus stop through a continuous beep in his device. Also that every time he crosses by a bus stop, his device would inform him the name of the bus stop. In this way he can successful travel to his destination.

In order to implement this, we are going to use java programming language. A Wi-Fi router should be installed at each bus stop, which would serve as a common network device to facilitate communication between all 3 devices (blind person, bus stop, bus). Firstly, when blind person reaches bus stop, his device automatically gets connected to bus stop device and he is informed about the current bus stop. He then inputs the bus/route number he intends to board. As the buses pass by the bus stop, the device inside the bus also gets connected to the wireless router. If the bus number currently connected to router matches the bus number entered by blind person, he starts getting a beep in his device. He can climb the bus. Also once he is inside the bus, every time he passes by a bus stop, his devices announce the name of the stop. In this way he can detect once he reaches his destination and successfully get down.
